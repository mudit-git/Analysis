Python Scripts for GROMACS Data Analysis

1. energy.py - Takes in the energy according to residues as an input and provides the graph
2. hbonds.py - Plots the number of hydrogen bonds created at every nanosecond through the simulation as a bar graph
3. rmsd.py - Plots the RMSD of the system as a line graph compared with the RMSD of the protein across 100 ns
4. rmsf_analysis.py - Plots the RMSF of the complex across 100 ns of simulation for n inputs upto 100 for comparative study
